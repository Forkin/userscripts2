### How it works
1. Fight at least ONCE for each opponent that you want to automatize.
2. The next time you try to fight against the same opponent, it will ask how many times you want to fight automatically.
3. If you cancel it, it will ask to reset the default movements for the current opponent and you will be able to fight against the opponent manually.
4. If you cancel it again, it will keep the movements saved.

If you don't fight the opponent at least once, the script will ask whether you want to use the default movements every time.

Go fight!
